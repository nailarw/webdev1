        There’s a path, a point in life, a moment 
        A moment of self realisation;
        When you stop giving people’s opinion one cent,
        Grey and not white or black was the idea of the mason 
        
        The rise of hypocrisy in your head and eyes
        Makes you stand tall and look of disgrace kissing your sight, forgot or ignored, you were looking right into your eyes,
        It’s always right if it’s you or the might!
        
        Ages ago, believed you can be all righteous with no wrongs, 
        Would the moon be this blissful even with one less crater?
        Shades of life colourful and grey all its songs,
        Adam and demon were both the children of the same maker!
        
        “Love the rain shower; it’s a gift of nature”,
        Was thinking of a stronger feeling than despise
        “How could you not love something that’s of nature”? 
        As if heat is enjoyed; you just love the colours of set and rise!
        
        Every clergy promises a fresh heaven for its men, 
        Men believing in them not a problem
        Ignored selfishness just declared hell for other beliefs and other men,
        
        I’m just counting the number of paradises, up there a city of Harlem?
        
        The murder you see is someone’s revenge,
        The corpse you cry for is the vultures manage,
        All day posted against animal brutality, weren’t you the one excited for the forest slashed for recreational utility? 
        
        The favourite hero and his victory run your blood and boost your pride,
        But the old Martin once said “a villain is always a hero on the other side”
        The ruptured society is you, and you are it’s guide!
        
        Soldiers glorified by their monarchs in Taj,
        Are just killers in patriotic camouflage! 
        Windy romance uprooted several shacks; such an imposter!
        Wait! You told me to love all the things made by the master…
        
        Wine never tasted different in a church or casino, 
        Yin is not complete without yang! 
        No matter what your selected color be so,
        It’s all grey; it’s all grey; it’s all grey; it’s all grey!
