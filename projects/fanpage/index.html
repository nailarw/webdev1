            <h3>Why I absolutely love Emancipator</h3>
            <p>In my favourite track <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTdT1REpMMQ" target="_blank">minor cause</a> there is something so surreal about the piece, its ability to transcend an individual through time and places. I could do a better job in explaining what the piece makes me feel but it is rather extremely difficult to do so. It is like an emotion without shape or form, It always becomes difficult for me to put the mood of these tracks into an emotional context. </p>

            <h3>Why you should give emancipator a chance</h3>
            <p>If you are looking for a mostly instrumental record that explores electronic and ambient themes cohesively, look no further. In “Lionheart” there is this cascading piano and supporting clean guitar part later supplemented by strings. You will hear a lot of this instrumentation throughout the record, but always used in different ways. The craziest part about the emotions conveyed through the tracks is that they are anomalous to me. In “When I Go” (Vocals by Thao Nguyen) you have the only vocally present track in the album, and despite that, the instruments betray each others emotions.
