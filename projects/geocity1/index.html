    <p>welcome to my homepage, this is interesting, just found some random things that looked cute, did i have a chance to make this website absolutey stunning yes i did, why didnt i do it? Time. I would love to rebuild this! though. Also angela davis is an icon her book are prisons obselete absolutely rock!When They See Us fulfils its purpose in reflecting societal issues and their impact through the narrative of the Central Park 5 case. The title itself propagates a striking message, implying prejudice against the African-American community and highlighting their othering and targeting. The moniker is demonstrative and enticing, putting itself on a pedestal by implicitly conveying the perspective from which this case is seen.
        The production also shows familial dynamics and social interdependence among African- American families, suggesting that false indictments or similar acts wreck a familys livelihood and economic stability. Not only is possibly the only source of income lost, but the emotional and mental support for single parents is taken away, and this is something that is rarely reported by the media. This may encourage the viewer to observe such instances in society in a new light, perhaps one that is more open-minded and considerate.To conclude, the production seamlessly depicts the transition of five individual teenagers being coalesced under a collective, adversarial identity in the nations eyes. When They See Us, nominated for 9 Emmy awards, examines the impact of being wrongfully indicted on the 4
        teenagers, and how adolescence and emotion interplay with discipline in the prison and juvenile detention centres. The narrative reflects racists stereotypes in America and their influence on a variety of stakeholders, in a concise but stimulating rendition. The show is successful in achieving its purpose.
